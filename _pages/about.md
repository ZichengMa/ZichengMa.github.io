#### `$ ls my_info`

Hello there!👋

My name is Zicheng Ma and I am an undergraduate student at [ZJUI](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/). My major is Computer Engineering and I am a senior student right now. BTW, I am applying for a Master degree in Computer Science starting from 2024 fall.🎓

I am currently working in UIUC [x-lab](https://github.com/xlab-uiuc/) with [Xudong Sun](https://marshtompsxd.github.io/). We are trying to build an verifiable controller framework [Anvil](https://github.com/vmware-research/verifiable-controllers).

#### `$ cat interest`

My research interest is Distributed System, System reliability and Cloud Native. Checkout the Anvil project above to get more information. I believe that stable and efficient distributed systems are meaningful to the world and distributed system itself will never become an outdated topic.😎

I am also interested in High Performance Computing but I have not started to make my hands dirty on HPC yet. Hopefully, I will do HPC projects in FA23 on my parallel programming course.

Beside my research interest, I am a deep coffee lover.☕️ Drinking and brewing coffee has become an unattainable part of my life. Every time I taste those wonderful flavors in coffee, such as jasmine, citrus, strawberry, etc., I feel a sense of happiness.

Whether you are interested in my scientific research or my coffee life, please feel free to contact me, I am looking forward to meeting more like-minded friends.

#### `$ echo $my_honor`
I have received the National Scholarship twice, an award bestowed upon only top 0.2% of Chinese university students, which is the highest honor a Chinese student can achieve. Additionally, I was recognized as a Finalist in the United States Mathematical Modeling Competition awarded to just 1% of participating teams worldwide. Beisdes, I have earned either the first-tier scholarships at my university, indicative of my consistent academic excellence and GPA ranking within the top one.
