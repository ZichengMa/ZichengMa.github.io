#### `$ ls my_info`

Hello there!üëã

My name is Zicheng Ma and I am an undergraduate student at [ZJUI](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/). My major is Computer Engineering and I am a senior student right now. In the Fall 24, I will go to Harvard to chase my master degree in Computational Science Engineering program.

Previously, I worked in UIUC [x-lab](https://github.com/xlab-uiuc/) with [Xudong Sun](https://marshtompsxd.github.io/). We are trying to build an verifiable controller framework [Anvil](https://github.com/vmware-research/verifiable-controllers). And our work has been accepted by OSDI 24 !!ü•≥

From August 2023 to Feburary 2024, I worked in Microsoft DKI group as an intern. My time at MSRA provided me with valuable insights into ML for Sys, HPC, AIOps, and the significance of robust cloud services. The experience awakened and strengthened my awareness of the critical role that a stable and an efficient system play in handling large-scale enterprise data.
#### `$ cat interest`

My research interest is Distributed System, System reliability and Cloud Native. Checkout the Anvil project above to get more information. I believe that stable and efficient distributed systems are meaningful to the world and distributed system itself will never become an outdated topic.üòé

Beside my research interest, I am a deep coffee lover.‚òïÔ∏è Drinking and brewing coffee has become an unattainable part of my life. I love drinking pour-our coffee and prefer light roast coffee with good acidity and cleanliness. Every time I taste those wonderful flavors in coffee, such as jasmine, citrus, strawberry, etc., I feel a sense of happiness.

Whether you are interested in my scientific research or my coffee life, please feel free to contact me, I am looking forward to meeting more like-minded friends.

#### `$ echo $my_honor`
I have won three times of National Scholarship, an award bestowed upon only top 0.2% of Chinese university students, which is the highest honor a Chinese student can achieve. Additionally, I was recognized as a Finalist in the United States Mathematical Modeling Competition awarded to just 1% of participating teams worldwide. Beisdes, I have earned either the first-tier scholarships at my university, indicative of my consistent academic excellence and GPA ranking within the top one.
