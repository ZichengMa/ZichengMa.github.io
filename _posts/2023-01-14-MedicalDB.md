# Medical Appointment DB

***B+ Tree, Hash Table, C++, UI***

This database system is built to distribute medical appointments. We assume there are several hospitals and many patients. Every patient has certain properties used to identify their priority. Based on the priority and hospitals' capacity, we will assign patients wisely.

We used C++ to build a B+ Tree as the base for our database system. To make it more user-friendly, we implemented a UI instead of relying solely on terminal commands. Additionally, we imitated a SQL-style query language to make our system easier to learn for those familiar with SQL.
