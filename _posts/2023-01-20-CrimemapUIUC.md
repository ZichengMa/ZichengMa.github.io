# CimeMap

**MySQL, ReactJS, NodeJS, Full-stack application**

We built a comprehensive database with records of past crimes occurring near UIUC, providing users with the ability to perform the standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the data through our web page. To further enhance the user experience, we integrated the Google Maps API, allowing users to view the crimes on a map and gain a better understanding of their relative locations. Our web page was created using ReactJS and NodeJS, while the database was implemented on a Google Cloud MySQL server, ensuring secure data storage and efficient retrieval.
