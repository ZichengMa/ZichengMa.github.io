# ZinixOS

Our OS has been depolyed as an online appication. If you want to have have a try, please click the [link](https://rong-hash.github.io/zinixos).

**C, x86 assembly, Operating System**

This ambitious project is a Unix-like operating system built on the qemu virtual machine. It is the culmination of our operating system design course and is a testament to the hard work and dedication we put into this project. We developed this operating system from the ground up, ensuring that we could support a wide range of features and functionalities. We also added a number of unique features to make it stand out from other operating systems. Ultimately, this project was a great success and we are proud of the hard work and dedication we put into making it a reality. I also found great interest in operating system during this course

- Basic functionalities: Implemented an operating system supporting fundamental features such as scheduling, interrupts, system calls, exceptions, and file systems.
- Additionally, self-designed features were utilised to enhance the system, such as an implicit free list and slab cache to implement a virtual memory allocation system. Furthermore, advanced signals, speaker and hard-disk drivers were also implemented to the system, allowing for an increase in functionality and performance.

## Show case of our OS

Two types of memory management

1. Fixed length memory allocation
2. Variable length memory allocation

### Fixed length — Slab Cache

```c
In this specific implementation, fixed length memory allocation is implemented by two parts, memory management unit and memory unit.
fixed length diagram:
        |memory management unit|  |memory management unit|  |memory management unit|  ..........    |memory unit|  |memory unit| |memory unit| .....
        |next|  --------------->  |next|  --------------->  |next|                                      ↑              ↑             ↑
        |ptr|---------------------|ptr|---------------------|ptr|---------------------------------------↑--------------↑-------------↑
```

Data structure: Linked list

- Slab_Create ( name , size )
- destroy , malloc , free
- Automatically shrinks and grows
- quick and fast to allocate and free
- granularity: 1byte - 4kB-8 bytes

### Variable length — Implicit free list

```c
On the other hand, variable length memory allocation is implemented very similar to Linux's implicit free list design. 
A memory part consists of two parts, memory management unit and real useable memory unit.
Memory management units are held in a linked list to track each memory fragments have been allocated.
variable length diagram:
        |memory mangement unit| -> |memory mangement unit| -> |memory mangement unit| -> |memory mangement unit|
        -----------------------    -----------------------    -----------------------    -----------------------
        |                     |    |                     |    |                     |    |                     |
        |   useable memory    |    |   useable memory    |    |   useable memory    |    |   useable memory    |
        |                     |    |                     |    -----------------------    |                     |
        |                     |    -----------------------                               -----------------------
        |                     |
        -----------------------

Slab cache's implementation is based on fixed length memory allocation.
```

Data structure: Implicit free list

- varmalloc( size )
- flexible: can allocate any size
- granularity: 1byte - 4MB

## Signal

Support users to set handler they define

Support sigreturn and set_handler syscall

Support five signals:

1. SIG_DIV_ZERO
2. SIG_SEGFAULT
3. SIG_INTERRUPT
4. SIG_ALARM
5. SIG_USER1

## ATA Hard Disk Support & File System

- Writable file system

  ```jsx
  write fname contents
  ```

- Persistent Change (after reboot) by saving the change to the hard drive

- How the file system is loaded and initialized:

## Speaker Driver

Key mapping:

(C3~E4) ZSXDCVGBHNJM,L.;/

(C4~G5) Q2W3ER5T6Y7UI9O0P[=]

Runs concurrently with any user programs & across terminals
